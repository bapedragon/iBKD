# IBAM KD H200 V2

Clean H200 experiment repository for CNN-to-ViT knowledge-distillation
experiments. The repository is being rebuilt from the teacher stage so that
LG, ALG, and Ours use the same low-resolution CNN guidance teacher.

## Current scope

The low-resolution teacher stage currently covers:

| Dataset | Teacher input | Selected Top-1 | Reference | Gap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CIFAR-100 | **32 x 32** | **71.91%** | 70.43% | +1.48 pp |
| Flowers-102 | **32 x 32** | **66.03%** | 66.33% | -0.30 pp |
| Chaoyang | **32 x 32** | **76.72%** | 77.20% | -0.48 pp |
| CUB-200-2011 | **32 x 32** | **37.25%** | - | - |

CUB-200-2011 has a verified shared scratch 32x32 ResNet56 teacher followed by
independent official LG, canonical paper ALG, and unchanged Ours students.
The completed results are `46.93%`, `49.02%`, and `48.72%`, respectively.
The combined timing/full runner and the Issue fields for both personal and lab
accounts are under
[`methods/LG/cub200/H200_ISSUE.md`](methods/LG/cub200/H200_ISSUE.md). CUB is
reported as a protocol transfer because the LG/ALG sources do not publish a
CUB configuration.

The new Table-1 CUB extension is a separate experiment family with the seven
paper backbones: DeiT-Ti, ConViT-Ti, CvT-13, PiT-Ti, PVTv2-B0, T2T-ViT-7,
and T2T-ViT-14. Each backbone runs Vanilla-b128, LG-b128, ALG-b128, Ours-b64,
and Ours-b128. Builds 543/547/548 and 551–556 completed the full 36-task
baseline matrix. The strongest guided results include T2T-ViT-7 Ours-b64
(**54.59%**), ConViT-Ti Ours-b64 (**53.18%**), and PVTv2-B0 Ours-b64
(**52.73%**). Every guided Table-1 student is code-locked to the build-543
teacher (**36.40%**, epoch 275) and SHA-256
`06f75192b1c108c89e480843cb4f72dfb28aa762d7b11e7ac327333dd54b51f5`.
The full verified matrix, complete **36-task** timing runner, audited
official-LG model sources, protocol, and validation-selected follow-up
instructions are under
[`methods/table1_cub200/`](methods/table1_cub200/). This family never imports
the primary build-509 teacher, ResNet50-224, or ImageNet-pretrained CUB
settings.

An additional, strictly separate CUB teacher-transfer family uses an
ImageNet1K-V2-pretrained ResNet50 teacher fine-tuned at **224 x 224**, while
its DeiT-Ti students still start from scratch. Its teacher, LG adaptation,
ALG adaptation, Ours run, output paths, timing runner, and H200 Issues all
carry `resnet50_224` names so they cannot be confused with the scratch
ResNet56-32 family. See
[`methods/cub200_resnet50_224/README.md`](methods/cub200_resnet50_224/README.md)
and
[`methods/cub200_resnet50_224/H200_ISSUE.md`](methods/cub200_resnet50_224/H200_ISSUE.md).
Because the official CUB page warns that some images overlap ImageNet, results
from this pretrained family must be reported separately from scratch-teacher
results.

Build 511 completed this historical teacher-only transfer sequence. The
ResNet50 teacher reached **84.10%**, followed by LG **35.19%**, ALG **29.72%**,
and Ours **30.65%**. All four available artifacts were verified and imported;
the students remain random-initialized and use the historical 300-epoch
horizon.

A third isolated CUB ablation keeps ResNet50 and both inputs at **224 x 224**
but changes the teacher initialization from ImageNet1K-V2 to random. It runs
two teacher-free Vanilla baselines before the corresponding LG/ALG and Ours
comparisons. The protocol, six-task runner, and copyable timing/full Issues are under
[`methods/cub200_resnet50_224_scratch/`](methods/cub200_resnet50_224_scratch/).
Its output root carries `resnet50_224_scratch` and cannot overwrite either
existing CUB family.

Build 519 completed all six tasks: teacher **48.31%**, Vanilla-b128
**17.52%**, LG **29.67%**, ALG **26.67%**, Vanilla-b64 **16.86%**, and Ours
**30.17%**. The re-supplied folder includes the previously missing teacher
directory. Its best/latest files, manifest, 200-row metrics, summary, strict
model load, and 224 x 224 forward pass were verified. The exact model tensors
are committed in compact form without optimizer state; the source hash and
lossless compaction record are preserved with the checkpoint.

The conventional full-transfer family initializes **both** the ResNet50
teacher and every DeiT-Ti student from ImageNet weights at **224 x 224**. Its
six-task sequence is Teacher, Vanilla-b128, LG, ALG, Ours-b64, and Ours-b128.
The teacher is fine-tuned for 200 epochs and all five pretrained students for
100 epochs; the shorter student horizon follows common CUB transfer practice
rather than the historical LG scratch schedule.
It is documented under
[`methods/cub200_full_transfer/`](methods/cub200_full_transfer/), including
separate copyable timing and full H200 Issues. The output root and protocol ID
carry `full_transfer` / `both_imagenet_pretrained` and cannot overwrite the
three earlier CUB families.

Build 523 completed this full-transfer sequence: teacher **84.10%**,
Vanilla-b128 **73.06%**, LG **75.61%**, ALG **74.16%**, Ours-b64 **73.71%**,
and Ours-b128 **74.85%**. All source artifacts were supplied and verified.
The build-523 teacher's 320 model tensors exactly match the existing build-511
teacher, so the compact checkpoint is reused while both source hashes and
training records are retained.

Its initialization-only paired control keeps that exact six-task order,
224 x 224 inputs, teacher 200-epoch horizon, student 100-epoch horizon, and
batch sizes, but initializes both ResNet50 and every DeiT-Ti from scratch.
It is isolated from the historical 300-epoch scratch family under
[`methods/cub200_both_scratch_100ep/`](methods/cub200_both_scratch_100ep/).
The dedicated runner, output names, validation locks, compact final summary,
and copyable timing/full H200 Issues all carry `both_scratch_100ep`.

The matching student-horizon ablation keeps that completed scratch teacher
recipe at 200 epochs and changes only all five student horizons from 100 to
300 epochs. It retains Vanilla-b128, LG, ALG, Ours-b64, and Ours-b128 in the
same order. It is isolated under
[`methods/cub200_both_scratch_300ep/`](methods/cub200_both_scratch_300ep/)
and must not be confused with the older scratch 300-epoch sequence that used
Vanilla-b64 instead of Ours-b128.

The Flowers implementation uses the official `train+val` split (2,040 images)
for training and the official test split (6,149 images) for evaluation.

All four selected low-resolution `best` checkpoints have passed SHA-256, strict state-dict,
metadata, and 32 x 32 forward checks. They are fixed before downstream KD and
must be reused across every compared method in the primary low-resolution
family. The separate ResNet50-224 CUB transfer experiment never replaces or
mixes with these checkpoints.

## Consolidated DeiT-Ti results (Table 2 format)

The table below is the repository's current reproduction table. It reports
only runs performed in this repository; it does not copy unrun LG/ALG values
from the draft paper.

| Method | Transfer operator | CIFAR-100 | Flowers-102 | Chaoyang | CUB-200 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Vanilla DeiT-Ti | - | 65.08 | 50.06 | 82.00 |  |
| KD | Logits | 69.10 | 48.95 | 62.79 |  |
| CRD | Pooled contrastive | 68.59 | 49.06 | 79.85 |  |
| ReviewKD | Projected fusion | 75.65 | 61.88 | 82.75 |  |
| MGD | Masked reconstruction | 75.68 | 54.66 | 81.81 |  |
| OFA | Logit-space projection | 67.73 | 46.41 | 78.03 |  |
| LG | Direct match (static) |  |  |  | 46.93 |
| ALG | Scheduled match (static) |  | 73.15 | 83.54 | 49.02 |
| **Ours** | **Grid-space, learnable** | **82.90** | **74.81** | **81.95\*** | **48.72** |

Blank cells mean that the method has not yet been run under its intended
method-specific protocol. Flowers ALG uses train batch 128 (`73.15%`) and
Chaoyang ALG uses train batch 64 (`83.54%`); both now have a committed best
checkpoint and adjacent run summary. `*` marks the completed Chaoyang Ours
H200 run whose `81.95%` final result is log-verified but whose archive is still
awaiting import. The three CUB students use the same scratch ResNet56 teacher
checkpoint (`37.25%`, epoch 283). Every unmarked non-Vanilla number above has
a committed best checkpoint and adjacent run summary.

The generic methods use the completed 300-epoch results. The selected Flowers
ALG value uses the isolated ALG-paper/public-LG protocol with train/eval batch
`128/200`. The selected Flowers Ours value uses the fully imported
CIFAR-100-matched researcher-sync protocol with train/eval batch `64/200`.
Both use 300 epochs, the official train+val (`2,040`) / test (`6,149`) split,
and seed 1, but they remain distinct protocol families. Exact protocol IDs,
best epochs, last-epoch values, historical runs, and artifact status are catalogued in
[`results/README.md`](results/README.md).

The complete locked protocol and source audit are recorded in
[`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md).
Ready-to-copy H200 request values are recorded in
[`H200_ISSUE.md`](H200_ISSUE.md).
Curated completed runs, selected best checkpoints, exact summaries, and result
tables are recorded in [`results/README.md`](results/README.md).
Runs that have started on H200 but whose artifacts have not yet been received
are tracked separately in
[`results/PENDING_IMPORTS.md`](results/PENDING_IMPORTS.md). A pending run is
never listed as a verified result.

The completed attribution and loss-balance controls are also imported. Table
4 reached `81.79%` for global joint-K/V permutation, `81.00%` for independent
K/V permutations, `82.46%` for local `2x2` permutation, and `83.12%` for the
token-space remeasurement. The pre-V2 Table 7 sweep is `83.29`, `83.40`,
`82.90`, `82.63`, and `82.29%` at lambda `0`, `0.25`, `0.5`, `0.75`, and
`1.0`. The separate Ours V2 relative-position pair reached `83.43%` at
lambda `0` and `82.84%` at lambda `0.5`. All controls live in distinct
provenance-rich protocol directories and do not replace the full-Ours
`82.90%` checkpoint.

The separate Ours v1 CIFAR-100 batch-128 ablation reached **82.60%** at epoch
292 (last **82.46%**), `0.30 pp` below the batch-64 researcher-sync reference.
It changes only train batch size and is stored under its own protocol ID.

## DeiT-Ti student stage

The V2 student pipeline supports all five generic methods in the draft table:
`KD -> CRD -> ReviewKD -> MGD -> OFA`. Every method reuses the selected fixed
teacher hash for its dataset while training a scratch DeiT-Ti at 224 x 224.
The original `ALG` baseline is independently integrated from the published
ALG equations and public LG feature path. Ours is synchronized to the later
researcher code: all 12 student blocks are aggregated, both teacher/student
features are resized to the larger stage grid (`32/16/14`), and the complete
`0.5*alignment + 0.5*fusion` loss drives the researcher's adaptive controller.
The earlier `32/16/8` and alignment-only-controller runs remain archived
diagnostics and are not mixed with the synchronized results.

The teacher input is derived from the same augmented student tensor using
bilinear resize to 32 x 32, so crop and flip geometry cannot drift between the
two branches. The teacher and student normalizations are applied separately.
Spatial feature methods bilinearly match the CNN feature grid to the DeiT
14x14 patch grid where required.

The active ALG reproduction is method-isolated from Ours: 300 epochs, batch
128, 20-epoch optimizer LR warm-up, no controller-only warm-up, cosine
`5e-4 -> 5e-6`, official LG strong augmentation, FP32, and seed 1. Its
three-case derivative follows the paper equations and disables guidance at
`smoothed_derivative >= -0.02`. See [`methods/ALG`](methods/ALG) for the full
audit and Chaoyang paper targets `83.50%` Top-1 / stop epoch `108`.

Run the full-data two-epoch timing sequence first. Flowers and Chaoyang can be
submitted as separate Issues in parallel:

```bash
python methods/run_five_methods.py --dataset flowers102 --timing-run \
  --output-dir /app/output/flowers102_five_methods_timing_v2 --num-workers 4

python methods/run_five_methods.py --dataset chaoyang --timing-run \
  --output-dir /app/output/chaoyang_five_methods_timing_v2 --num-workers 4
```

Alternatively, one Issue can measure all ten dataset-method combinations:

```bash
python methods/run_flowers_chaoyang_timing.py \
  --num-workers 4
```

The timing artifacts stay in the temporary clone by default; all duration
estimates needed for job packing are printed in the Issue log. Full training
must instead use an explicit singular `/app/output/...` collection path.

For the harmonized 300-epoch rerun, the measured per-epoch times predict
Chaoyang five methods in `3h 41m 30s` and Flowers five methods in
`4h 36m 48s`. The dedicated short-first batch runs all ten in `8h 18m 18s`,
leaving `1h 41m 42s` below the 600-minute Pod limit:

```bash
python methods/run_flowers_chaoyang_300ep.py --num-workers 4 \
  --output-dir /app/output/generic_kd_flowers_chaoyang_300ep_seed42
```

This rerun changes only the epoch count and the corresponding cosine horizon.
Flowers/Chaoyang batch size 64, warm-up 5, augmentation, seed 42, fixed
teachers, adapters, and every method-specific loss remain unchanged. The older
100/200-epoch results remain historical records rather than being silently
overwritten.

The legacy-named Ours/ALG batch runner is now method-separated. It executes
researcher-sync Ours on CIFAR-100 and Flowers-102, then canonical
paper/official-LG ALG on Flowers-102. The Ours runs retain batch 64 and their
controller; ALG uses batch 128 and the paper controller. All tasks use
independent output directories:

```bash
python methods/run_researcher_sync_ours_alg.py --timing-run --num-workers 4

python methods/run_researcher_sync_ours_alg.py --full-run --num-workers 4 \
  --output-dir /app/output/researcher_sync_ours_alg_300ep_seed1
```

Run the timing command first. Its final `[POD_LIMIT_CHECK]` reports `PASS` or
`FAIL`, the combined 300-epoch estimate, and exact headroom/overrun against the
current 600-minute Pod limit. Do not submit the combined full run on `FAIL`;
split the three independent jobs across Issues instead.

For the Flowers paper-style dataset accounting, use the dedicated runner
below. It trains on official train+val (`2,040`) and evaluates/selects the best
checkpoint on official test (`6,149`). ALG and Ours are deliberately separated: ALG uses the
ALG paper plus public LG code, while Ours uses the Ours paper and supplied Ours
source first and falls back to ALG/LG only for unspecified settings. The runner
executes ALG first and Ours second, then prints both selected best results at
the end. This protocol family does not overwrite earlier runs.

```bash
python methods/run_flowers_official_split_ours_alg.py --timing-run \
  --num-workers 4

python methods/run_flowers_official_split_ours_alg.py --full-run \
  --num-workers 4 \
  --output-dir /app/output/flowers102_trainval_test_alg_ours_300ep_seed1
```

The earlier measured Flowers and Chaoyang total was 4h 39m 31s. One measured
CIFAR-100 method could therefore be appended safely in the same 600-minute
Pod. That historical full batch ran Chaoyang five methods, Flowers five
methods, and then CIFAR-100 KD:

```bash
python methods/run_combined_full_batch.py --cifar-method KD \
  --output-dir /app/output/combined_flowers_chaoyang_cifar100_kd_v2 \
  --num-workers 4
```

The expected total is 7h 45m 59s, leaving approximately 2h 14m under the Pod
limit. Dataset and method directories remain independent throughout the batch.

Each method writes its own `student_best.pt`, `student_latest.pt`, and
`summary.json` under a distinct run directory. The runner additionally writes
`five_method_status.json` and `five_method_summary.json`; therefore no method
can overwrite another method's files. Its timing summary provides individual
and combined full-run estimates for packing jobs safely below the 600-minute
Pod limit. See [`methods/README.md`](methods/README.md) for the locked base
protocols and each method directory for exact losses, official-code provenance,
and heterogeneous adapters.

Historical Ours runs remain labeled by their exact grid/controller family.
Current researcher-sync Ours uses the supplied-source larger-grid rule
`32/16/14` and must be timed separately from older paper-grid diagnostics;
see [`H200_ISSUE.md`](H200_ISSUE.md).

## Fixed teachers for downstream KD

The selected weights and their full provenance are under
[`teachers/checkpoints`](teachers/checkpoints). Before launching a KD job, run:

```bash
python teachers/verify_checkpoints.py --dataset all
```

This verifies each committed SHA-256, checkpoint metadata, strict model load,
output dimensions, and finite 32 x 32 inference. The loader also freezes the
returned teacher parameters for downstream use.

## Why 32 x 32?

The original LG paper explicitly uses a ResNet56 guidance model trained on
32 x 32 images. The ViT student is trained separately at 224 x 224. These are
two different input branches and should not be confused with the 224 x 224
ResNet18 CNN baseline in the LG paper.

Sources:

- LG paper: <https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2022/papers_ECCV/papers/136840108.pdf>
- LG official code: <https://github.com/lkhl/tiny-transformers>
- Audited official commit: `d2165f74049c906b0afc9f957491960fb3c0cc8b`

## H200 timing run (recommended first)

The timing run uses the full CIFAR-100 dataset for two epochs while keeping the
300-epoch cosine schedule. Its artifacts remain inside the temporary cloned
repository and therefore do not need to be collected.

```bash
python teachers/train_teacher_cifar100.py --timing-run --num-workers 4
```

Expected log markers:

- `[PROTOCOL_CHECK] status=PASS`
- `[MODEL] teacher_params=861,620`
- `[DATA] train_samples=50000 test_samples=10000`
- `[TIMING] estimated_300_teacher=...`
- `[DONE] Teacher training completed successfully`

## H200 full training

After the timing run succeeds, use:

```bash
python teachers/train_teacher_cifar100.py --output-dir /app/output --run-name teacher_resnet56_cifar100_32_lg_official_seed1 --num-workers 4
```

The core full-run values are already fixed to the official settings, so the
command does not need to repeat epoch, batch-size, image-size, learning-rate,
or seed arguments.

## Collected artifacts

The full command writes the following directory:

```text
/app/output/teacher_resnet56_cifar100_32_lg_official_seed1/
├── teacher_resnet56_cifar100_32_best.pt
├── teacher_resnet56_cifar100_32_latest.pt
├── teacher_resnet56_cifar100_32_closest_to_lg_reference.pt
├── config.json
├── metrics.csv
└── summary.json
```

- `best.pt`: highest test Top-1; primary teacher checkpoint.
- `latest.pt`: epoch 300 state.
- `closest_to_lg_reference.pt`: closest observed result to 70.43%; diagnostic
  only, not the primary reported result.
- `summary.json`: final accuracy, timing, paths, hashes, and protocol metadata.

Checkpoints contain both `model_state` (official LG-style key) and `model`
aliases, as well as accuracy, epoch, optimizer state, architecture metadata,
and preprocessing metadata for downstream loading.

## Local smoke test

This checks imports, model forward/backward, data preparation, and checkpoint
creation on deterministic subsets:

```bash
python teachers/train_teacher_cifar100.py --smoke --num-workers 0
```

Smoke/timing accuracy is not a research result.

## Flowers-102 selected 450-epoch teacher protocol

The repository keeps one selected Flowers teacher recipe: ResNet56 trained
from scratch for 450 epochs at 32 x 32. It uses the public LG strong
augmentation path:

- random resized crop to 32 with bicubic interpolation;
- horizontal flip;
- RandAugment `rand-m9-mstd0.5-inc1`;
- random erasing probability 0.25;
- ImageNet normalization.

ResNet56, 32 x 32 input, scratch training, SGD 0.1, momentum 0.9, Nesterov,
weight decay 5e-4, batch size 128, cosine decay, and seed 1 remain unchanged.
The draft target is 66.33%; the selected checkpoint reaches 66.03% Top-1 at
epoch 389. The 450-epoch schedule is a documented implementation choice
because the public LG repository has no Flowers teacher YAML.

Optional two-epoch timing check retaining the 450-epoch cosine schedule:

```bash
python teachers/train_teacher_flowers.py --timing-run --num-workers 4
```

For the collected full run, write to `/app/output`:

```bash
python teachers/train_teacher_flowers.py --output-dir /app/output --run-name teacher_resnet56_flowers102_32_strongaug_450ep_seed1 --num-workers 4
```

The full Flowers directory contains `best`, `latest`, and
`closest_to_reference` checkpoints plus `config.json`, `metrics.csv`, and
`summary.json`. Only the selected 450-epoch result and protocol are maintained
in this repository.
Timing-run accuracy is not a research result.

## Pure ALG batch comparison and CIFAR-locked Ours

One Pod can run the requested four independent 300-epoch tasks in sequence:

```bash
python methods/run_alg_batch_ablation_ours_chaoyang.py --timing-run \
  --num-workers 4

python methods/run_alg_batch_ablation_ours_chaoyang.py --full-run \
  --num-workers 4 \
  --output-dir /app/output/alg_batch_ablation_ours_chaoyang_300ep_seed1
```

The order is pure ALG Flowers batch 64, pure ALG Chaoyang batch 128, pure ALG
Chaoyang batch 64, then Ours Chaoyang batch 64. Pure ALG follows the ALG
equations and public LG base without Ours settings. Ours follows the
researcher-synchronized protocol that produced the selected CIFAR-100 result.
Every run has its own directory, and the final log prints all four Best Top-1
values plus the combined 600-minute Pod-limit check.

## Chaoyang timing and full runs

Chaoyang is read from the persistent mount at `/app/data/chaoyang`. The script
validates all 4,021/2,139 JSON records, class counts, files, and 512 x 512 source
image format before training.

Run the full-data two-epoch timing check first:

```bash
python teachers/train_teacher_chaoyang.py --timing-run --num-workers 4
```

After it prints `[PROTOCOL_CHECK] status=PASS` and `[DONE]`, run:

```bash
python teachers/train_teacher_chaoyang.py --output-dir /app/output --run-name teacher_resnet56_chaoyang_32_moderateaug_300ep_seed1 --num-workers 4
```

The statistical recipe is fixed at ResNet56, 32 x 32, 300 epochs, SGD 0.1,
batch size 128, and seed 1. The exact Chaoyang teacher YAML is unavailable, so
the moderate crop policy is explicitly recorded as an implementation choice.

## Failure behavior

All important messages are printed with `flush=True`. Python exceptions print
a complete traceback and `[FATAL]`; successful completion prints `[DONE]`.
Checkpoints and summaries are rewritten atomically every completed epoch, so a
normal Python failure cannot leave a half-written checkpoint.
