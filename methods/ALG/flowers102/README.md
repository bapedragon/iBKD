# ALG: Flowers-102 / DeiT-Ti

The current official-split entry point isolates ALG from Ours. It uses the
ALG-paper optimization/method protocol, the public LG feature path, and the
adaptive schedule defined by the ALG equations. No Ours configuration or Ours
module is used.

The active split now matches the ALG paper's dataset accounting: official
train and val are concatenated into `2,040` training images, and the official
`6,149`-image test split is used for evaluation. No Ours setting is injected
into ALG.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---:|
| Teacher | fixed ResNet56, native `32 x 32` |
| Student | DeiT-Ti from scratch, `224 x 224` |
| Current split | official train+val `2,040` / test `6,149` |
| Checkpoint selection | highest official-test Top-1 |
| Reported result | best official-test Top-1 |
| Epochs | 300 |
| Train / eval batch | 128 / 200 |
| Optimizer | AdamW |
| LR / minimum LR | `5e-4` / `5e-6` |
| Weight decay | `0.05` |
| Warm-up | 20 epochs, factor `0.001` |
| Schedule | cosine |
| Label smoothing / drop path | `0.0` / `0.1` |
| Seed / precision | 1 / FP32 |
| Augmentation | public LG strong augmentation |
| ALG beta / threshold / window | `2.5` / `-0.02` / 50 |
| Controller stop warm-up | none; evaluate as soon as the derivative exists |
| Stop condition | paper Eq. (19): stop at `smoothed_derivative >= tau` |
| Early derivative | ALG Eq. (16), explicit `1/e` normalization |
| Grid alignment | larger of teacher/student, bilinear |

The ALG paper's DeiT-Ti comparison point is `69.04%` Top-1 with guidance
ending at epoch `188`.

## Completed H200 result

The pure ALG-paper/public-LG run completed with **73.15% best test Top-1**.
The complete build-479 log and sequence summary verify best epoch 274,
last-epoch Top-1 `72.92%`, and guidance-stop epoch 214. Its best checkpoint and
per-run summary are committed under
`results/ALG/flowers102/paper_lg_v2_trainval_test_b128_300ep_seed1/`. The older
researcher-sync batch-64 ALG checkpoint (`75.02%`) is not substituted for this
selected result.

Build 480 separately tested the same pure-ALG family with train batch 64. It
reached `75.05%` at epoch 298, ended at `74.60%`, and stopped guidance at epoch
185. Its checkpoint and summary are stored under
`results/ALG/flowers102/paper_lg_v2_trainval_test_b64_300ep_seed1/`. This is a
batch ablation, not a replacement for the selected batch-128 row.

Timing run:

```bash
python methods/ALG/flowers102/train.py --timing-run --num-workers 4
```

Full run:

```bash
python methods/ALG/flowers102/train.py --num-workers 4 \
  --run-name alg_flowers102_deit_ti_trainval_test_300ep_seed1 \
  --output-dir /app/output
```

`train.py` is now the canonical entry point. The older batch-64/controller-
warm-up results remain labeled historical artifacts only; they are not
reachable through the active ALG wrapper and are never substituted for the
paper-protocol run.
