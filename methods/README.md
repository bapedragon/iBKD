# Distillation methods

This directory contains the V2 ResNet56-to-DeiT-Ti student pipelines for the
five generic KD baselines in the draft table: KD, CRD, ReviewKD, MGD, and OFA.
The paper's `Ours` implementation is maintained separately under
[`Ours`](Ours) because its ALG-controlled grid-preserving feature objective is
not a generic KD baseline. Static official [`LG`](LG) and canonical
[`ALG`](ALG) are independent baselines: ALG is the published adaptive
controller on the official LG code mechanics, with no Ours optimizer or
controller setting. They share the same fixed teacher checkpoint for fair
comparison, but each method keeps its own published training protocol.

Every method/dataset directory owns an executable `train.py` and a local
`README.md`. The sequential scripts in this directory are scheduling helpers:
they launch those independent entry points as subprocesses and keep every run
in a separate output directory.

`run_alg_batch_ablation_ours_chaoyang.py` is the four-task method-isolated
batch runner. It executes pure ALG Flowers batch 64, pure ALG Chaoyang batch
128 and 64, and finally the CIFAR-100-locked researcher-sync Ours Chaoyang
batch 64 run. All tasks use distinct protocol IDs and output directories.

Flowers Ours and ALG additionally provide the active comparison wrappers
`train_official_split.py`. Despite the historical filename, these now enforce
the ALG-paper dataset accounting used across Flowers experiments: official
train+val `2,040` for training and official test `6,149` for evaluation and
best-checkpoint selection. The method protocols remain independent.

## Locked common student protocols

| Dataset | Epochs | Batch | Warm-up | Student input | Teacher input |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| CIFAR-100 | 300 | 128 | 20 | 224 x 224 | 32 x 32 |
| Flowers-102 | 200 | 64 | 5 | 224 x 224 | 32 x 32 |
| Chaoyang | 100 | 64 | 5 | 224 x 224 | 32 x 32 |

### Harmonized 300-epoch rerun

The current comparison rerun fixes all three datasets to 300 student epochs.
For Flowers-102 and Chaoyang this is an **epoch-only override**: their batch
size remains 64, warm-up remains 5, and all other common and method-specific
values below remain unchanged. The cosine scheduler horizon is necessarily
extended to 300 together with the training length.

| Dataset | Rerun epochs | Batch | Warm-up | Changed from historical run |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Flowers-102 | **300** | 64 | 5 | epochs/cosine horizon only (was 200) |
| Chaoyang | **300** | 64 | 5 | epochs/cosine horizon only (was 100) |

```bash
python methods/run_flowers_chaoyang_300ep.py --num-workers 4 \
  --output-dir /app/output/generic_kd_flowers_chaoyang_300ep_seed42
```

The measured estimate is `8h 18m 18s`, leaving `1h 41m 42s` under the
600-minute Pod limit. Execution is short-first (`Chaoyang -> Flowers-102`),
and every method writes an independent result directory.

The established low-resolution and historical CUB families use scratch
DeiT-Ti (`deit_tiny_patch16_224`), AdamW with initial
learning rate `5e-4` and weight decay `0.05`, cosine decay after warm-up, label
smoothing `0.1`, CUDA AMP, seed `42`, and test Top-1 evaluation. No external
student pretrained weights are used in those families. The separately labeled
CUB full-transfer experiment under
[`cub200_full_transfer/`](cub200_full_transfer/) is the explicit exception:
both ResNet50 and DeiT-Ti use ImageNet initialization.

Training uses random resized crop to 224 (`scale=0.8-1.0`, bicubic) and random
horizontal flip. Evaluation uses resize to 256 and center crop to 224.
CIFAR-100 uses CIFAR normalization for the student; Flowers and Chaoyang use
ImageNet normalization.

The teacher does **not** receive an independently augmented image. The exact
student view is converted back to image space, bilinearly resized from 224 to
32, and normalized with the ImageNet statistics used to train the fixed
teacher. Crop and flip geometry therefore remains shared across both branches.

## Method-specific operators

| Method | Transfer | V2 CNN-to-ViT connection |
|---|---|---|
| KD | class logits | no spatial adapter |
| CRD | pooled representation | ResNet stage-3 GAP `64d`; DeiT CLS pre-logits `192d` |
| ReviewKD | multi-level features | ResNet 32/16/8 grids bilinearly resized to DeiT 14x14 grid |
| MGD | masked reconstruction | ResNet stage-3 8x8 bilinearly resized to 14x14; DeiT block-11 tokens; `192 -> 64` alignment |
| OFA | projected class logits | DeiT blocks 1/3/9/11 and official-behavior transformer projectors |
| ALG | adaptive LG features | public LG blocks 0/6/11, stages 0/1/2, larger-grid matching, ALG stop rule |
| Ours | adaptive grid-preserving features | all 12 DeiT blocks, ResNet stages 1/2/3, V3 teacher grids `32/16/8`, ALG beta schedule |

## Historical CIFAR-100 Ours + CRD + MGD timing

H200 build 451 measured the fixed V2 32 x 32 teacher sequence, but its Ours
entry used the supplied-source `32/16/14` grid rather than the now-selected V3
`32/16/8` paper grid:

```bash
python methods/run_cifar100_ours_crd_mgd.py --timing-run \
  --output-dir /app/output/cifar100_ours_crd_mgd_timing_v2 --num-workers 4
```

| Method | Measured 300-epoch estimate |
|---|---:|
| Ours | `4h 08m 37s` |
| CRD | `3h 15m 04s` |
| MGD | `3h 03m 26s` |
| Total | `10h 27m 07s` |

The old total exceeded the 600-minute limit. Do not reuse its Ours estimate
for current scheduling. Run a paper-grid timing check first; CRD and MGD do
not depend on this Ours grid decision. Every method still writes an
independent directory.

```bash
python methods/run_cifar100_ours_crd_mgd.py --full-run --methods MGD \
  --output-dir /app/output/cifar100_mgd_full_v2 --num-workers 4
```

Method settings and official-code provenance are recorded under each method
directory. The CNN-to-ViT adapters are explicit V2 implementation choices;
they are not presented as the original CNN-to-CNN configurations.

## Five-method timing and full execution

The generic runner executes each selected method as a separate Python
subprocess in canonical order:

```bash
python methods/run_five_methods.py --dataset flowers102 --timing-run \
  --output-dir /app/output/flowers102_five_methods_timing_v2 --num-workers 4

python methods/run_five_methods.py --dataset chaoyang --timing-run \
  --output-dir /app/output/chaoyang_five_methods_timing_v2 --num-workers 4
```

To collect all ten timings in one Issue and one combined summary:

```bash
python methods/run_flowers_chaoyang_timing.py \
  --num-workers 4
```

This upper-level runner writes `two_dataset_timing_status.json` and
`two_dataset_timing_summary.json`, while preserving both per-dataset summaries
for the lifetime of the timing Pod. Every required estimate is also printed.

Every method has its own run directory and writes `student_best.pt`,
`student_latest.pt`, and `summary.json`. The runner writes
`five_method_status.json` while running and `five_method_summary.json` after
success. A later failure stops the sequence but does not delete artifacts from
already completed methods.

The final timing log reports each method's average epoch time and full-run
estimate plus the combined estimate. Use an ordered subset when the measured
total would leave insufficient margin under the 600-minute Pod limit:

```bash
python methods/run_five_methods.py --dataset flowers102 --full-run \
  --methods KD CRD ReviewKD --output-dir /app/output/flowers102_group1_v2 \
  --num-workers 4

python methods/run_five_methods.py --dataset flowers102 --full-run \
  --methods MGD OFA --output-dir /app/output/flowers102_group2_v2 \
  --num-workers 4
```

The exact grouping must be chosen from the returned H200 timing log. A safe
target is at most about 540 minutes per Issue, leaving roughly one hour for
downloads, setup, evaluation, checkpoint writes, and runtime variance.

## Measured combined full batch

H200 build 449 measured Flowers five methods at `3h 20m 01s` and Chaoyang five
methods at `1h 19m 30s`. Appending the measured CIFAR-100 KD estimate of
`3h 06m 28s` gives `7h 45m 59s`, which retains `2h 14m 01s` below the
600-minute limit.

```bash
python methods/run_combined_full_batch.py --cifar-method KD \
  --output-dir /app/output/combined_flowers_chaoyang_cifar100_kd_v2 \
  --num-workers 4
```

Execution is short-first: Chaoyang all five, Flowers all five, then CIFAR-100
KD. This maximizes the number of completed results preserved if a later task
fails. The runner also accepts the other already measured CIFAR choices `CRD`
and `ReviewKD`; all three plans retain more than two hours below the Pod limit.
